# Advent of Code 2022

I'm trying to use SQL to solve these, but I'm sure I will run out of runway with SQL and end up
having to use some other programming language.

To execute the SQL scripts, move into the `./src/` directory and run with something like this:

```
sqlite3 < 2.sql
```
which should output:
```
part_1
------
13446

part_2
------
13509
```

As I add other programming languages, I will add instructions on how to run, or maybe add a
makefile at the top level to handle it all for you.
